# ML Problems

This repo focuses primarily on problems that I have addressed via machine learning (ML). Since this is data that is pulled in Higher Education, I am bound by FERPA laws and cannot share the data so that one can run the code. Instead, I can only share the code I have written and explain the outcomes and benefits that were derived as a result of the work. 

# Algorithms

In my work as a data scientist, I have worked with many different stakeholders, from marketing to sales (admissions/recruiters), retention specialists (academic advising), to department heads (Deans) and, of course, VPs over entire divisions (academics and enrollment management). In here you will see projects that apply k-prototype algorithms in conjunction with geolocation of students, classification models that accurately predict which students are most likely to persist from one semester to another and which are most likely to retain from Fall to Fall, time series forecasting for semester enrollments, regression analysis to predict revenue, all completed in both Baysian statistics and Frequentist statistics. 

# The Data

The data is pulled from Oracle's Banner DB using PL/SQL. Again, I can share the code but not the data.


# Retention Prediction

Retention is defined as Fall to Fall enrollment at colleges and universities. It is the proportion of students from the previous Fall semester who are enrolled in the current Fall semester and is one of the main concerns at colleges today. The goal with this model development is to identify the students who are most likely to *not* retain from Fall to Fall so that early intervention can start in their first Fall semester. Just as businesses want to retain customers because it is cheaper than gaining new ones, so to for colleges.

# The Data

There are 28792 rows and 33 columns. Not all columns are actually predictors. The final data frame for analysis has fewer columns. The IDs of each student have been removed so that there is no way to identify the students. Also, they are unnecessary for analysis. There is also no location identifier for the students such as longitude and latitude. The final dataframe for analysis has 20 predictors and one response variable.

<u>Predictors</u>

  * *stype* (string): Has multiple levels that denote the student type, such as "New Student," "Guest" student, "Transfer" student.
  * *gender* (string): Self identified gender of every student at the college.
  * *ethn_desc* (string): Self identified ethnicity of each student (a little over 6% was missing. These students were not deleted but rather just given the attribute of "Missing," thus creating a new level for the ethnic description). 
  * *resd* (string): The residency of the student as determined by the student address.
  * *acd_std_desc* (string): The academic standing of the student (i.e. "Academic Suspension," "Academic Probation," "Good Standing").
  * *fully_online* (string): Designation of whether *all* of the student's classes are online or in-person.
  * *age* (integer): The age the student was relative to the semester in which they were enrolled. Students above the age of 60 were exclusively current faculty, spouses of faculty, previous faculty or spouses of previous faculty. In the five Fall semesters considered, with 28,792 students, only 123 of them fell into this group. Those 123 were removed since they are not the target group the college is trying to retain and because including them severely skewed the age predictor, unnecessarily so. The age predictor also had the peculiarity of three students who were below the age of two years old. These three students had incorrect birthdays and were also removed, leaving a range of students between 14 and 60 years old. 
  * *inst_earned* (float): The number of credit hours a student has *earned* at the instiution.
  * *term_att_crhr* (float): The number of credit hours a student has *attempted* for the given semester.
  * *term_earn_crhr* (float): The number of credit hours a student has *earned* for the given semester.
  * *term_gpa* (float): The Grade Point Average (GPA) a student earns in a specific semester.
  * *inst_gpa* (float): The Grade Point Average a student has earned at the institution. 
  * *no_pell* (integer): An indicator variable of 1 or 0 for a student who has not received a Pell grant.
  * *pell* (integer): An indicator variable of 1 or 0 for a student who has received a Pell grant.
  * *subsidized* (integer): An indicator variable of 1 or 0 for a student who has received a subsidized loan.
  * *unsubsidized* (integer): An indicator variable of 1 or 0 for a student who has received an unsubsidized loan.
  * *summer_plus* (integer): An indicator variable of 1 or 0 for a student who received tuition reimbursement for participating in the summer plus program at the institution.
  * *kansas_promise* (integer): An indicator variable of 1 or 0 for a student who is receiving a scholarship through Kansas Promise.
  * *all_fafsa* (integer): A numeric value from 0 to $n$ that represents the total number of *accepted* scholarships, loans, and grants a student has for a given semester. 
  * *hs_matriculation* (string): Binary variable that records whether the student enrolled in the Fall directly after their HS graduation or not.
  
<u>Response</u>

  * *enrolled* (string): A binary outcome that indicates whether a student enrolled for the Fall semester who was present at the institution in the previous Fall semester. This is traditionally referred to in the research literature as *retention*. 
  
This analysis covers the last five Fall semesters at the institution, Fall 2019, Fall 2020, Fall 2021, Fall 2022, and Fall 2023. Since the goal is to predict which students from the previous Fall semester reenroll in the next Fall semester (i.e. retention), the only semesters actually kept are 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. This is because checking which students from Fall 2022 reenrolled in Fall 2023 only requires that Fall 2022 be compared against Fall 2023 to see which students from Fall 2022 ended up in Fall 2023. Retention for Fall 2023 cannot yet be calculated because that is only possible once Fall 2024 starts. *Retention*, in the research literature, is defined as the proportion of students from the previous Fall semester that enroll in the current Fall semester.

The response variable was created by comparing the students who enrolled in the previous Fall to the list of students who enrolled in the current Fall semester. When an ID was matched in both semesters, that student was noted as "Enrolled"; when a student from the previous Fall did not match an ID in the current Fall semester, that student was noted as "Not Enrolled." The "Not Enrolled" to "Enrolled" ratio is 0.5942 (N = 11735) to 0.5942 (N = 17182). While this dataset is imbalanced, it is not so severe that it warrants using strategies such as SMOTE, ADASYN, or Random Undersampling to address it. 

Several other variables were not native to the database but were created. *Fully_Online* was a variable created by looping through the location designation in the database for each class in each student schedule, counting the number of online courses a student was in, and dividing that number by the total number of courses in which the student was enrolled. If one hundred percent of their courses were online, the student was designated as "fully online," and if even one course was in-person, the student was labeled as "Not Fully Online." *no_pell*, *pell*, *subsidized*, *unsubsidized*, *summer_plus*, and *kansas_promise* were all created from the financial aid data. There are hundreds of financial aid designations between these monikers and all of the other scholarships available. A student could feasibly have all of the last five of the attributes (pell, subsidized, unsubsidized, summer_plus, and kansas_promise) since each of these is created as a dummy variable. The only one that implies the student received no scholarships, loans, or pell grant monies is if the student is labeled as "no_pell." The last generated variable is *hs_matriculation* which is a variable created by comparing the year the student graduated high school to the year they started in the Fall. For instance, if a student graduated high school in May 2020 and enrolled for college in Fall of 2020, a three month time span in between graduation and first start, that student is labeled as "From HS." Those that did not enroll right after high school are labeled as "Not From HS." 

Summer+ was a promotional by the college for students to take at least six credits in the summer. If a student took at least six credits during the summer, then three free credits were awarded to that student in the Fall. Because of this, the hypothesis is that it influenced students to enroll in the following Fall. About fifty percent of the students who enroll in the Summer were enrolled in the immediate Fall semester that preceded it. Therefore, since retention is tracking Fall to Fall enrollment, this seemed like a good predictor to include. 

Kansas Promise is a scholarship started by the state of Kansas that has very specific stipulations. "The bill permits students to enroll on a part-time or full-time basis, but students must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the promise-eligible program and complete the program within 36 months from the first award.  Upon completion of the program, students must reside and work in Kansas for a minimum of two consecutive years or enroll in a Kansas institution of higher education and subsequently reside and work in Kansas for a minimum of two consecutive years" (KBOR, 2023). https://kansasregents.org/students/student_financial_aid/promise-act-scholarship Given that students have to finish within 36 months and must maintain satisfactory progress (meaning they cannot be placed on academic suspension), this was a good predictor to include. If a student fails to maintain satisfactory progress or does not finish in 36 months, the student will have to pay back the funds provided plus accrued interest at the federal PLUS program interest rate (ibid.). 

Finally, the reference level was manually set for two of the categorical variables, *ethn_desc* and *stype*. For the ethnic description, the reference level is set to "Caucasian/White" and for the student type, the reference level was set to "Continuing Student." 

## Eliminate Collinear Variables

There are a number of variables that are derivations of others or are simply duplicates. For instance *totcr*, reports the total number of credits a student attempted for the given semester. *term_att_crhr* reveals the same thing. Therefore, I will eliminate *totcr*. Similarly, *status* is a designation based on an aggregate of the number of credits a student is in during the given semester. A student who is less than 6 credits is less than half time. A student who is in 6 - 11 credits is half time. A student who is in 12 or more credits is full time. This is collinear with the *term_att_crhr* once again, which is why it is being removed as well. *cnty_desc1* and *resd_desc* are unnecessary because they are collinear with the *resd*. While *degcode* is not collinear with anything, it is not a particularly helpful predictor, which is why it is not being used. *pidm* is also repetitive and unnecessary. The correlation matrix showed that two of the variables are highly correlated. 

### Correlation Plot

```{r echo = FALSE}

library(corrplot)

predictors <- c('age', 'term_att_crhr', 'term_gpa', 'inst_gpa', 'term_earn_crhr', 'inst_earned', 'inst_hrs_att', 'overall_gpa')

# Specify the file name and resolution
png(filename = "correlation_plot.png", width = 800, height = 800, res = 100)

# Develop correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(enrolled[predictors], use = 'complete.obs')

# Create the plot
corrplot(cor_matrix, 
         method = 'number', 
         type = 'lower', 
         tl.cex = 1,
         tl.srt = 45)
title(main = 'Correlation Plot of Numeric Predictors', 
      line = 3,
      cex.main = 1.75)

# Close the device
dev.off()

```

After viewing the correlation matrix, removing the "overall_gpa" and "inst_hrs_att" variables is best because they are 97% and 93% correlated with "inst_gpa" and "inst_earned," respectively. Therefore, it is near impossible to know which is truly contributing to the prediction. "Overall GPA" was removed because it includes transfer grades, which not all students have but all students do have an "Institutional GPA." "Institutional Hours Attempted" was removed because what is more important is the number of credits the student completed rather than what they attempted.

Higher education is typically attended by the young, which makes the *age* verses *enrolled* violin plot unsurprising. There is a higher concentration of students between 18-20 years old for those that retain from Fall to Fall than for those that do not. The median age for retained students is 19.5 years old where as the median age of those that do not retain from Fall to Fall is nearly a year older at 20.4 years old. 

The attempted credit hours per semester for the students who retained from Fall to Fall is one credit hour higher for each quartile than for those that do not retain from Fall to Fall. Moreover, there is a higher concentration of students who are full-time (i.e. 12 credit hours or more) for those that retain from Fall to Fall. One must be very careful here, because some researchers (Ad Astra 2023 conference) are tempted to claim from this that *academic momentum*, as they call it, has a *causal* effect on retention. This could not be further from the truth. As a domain expert who has met with nearly 18,000 students in nine years, I can attest that the amount of credit hours in which a student enrolls is *reflective* of the student's outside obligations. The mistake is saying that credit hours are the driver of retention. It is not, "Put students in more credits, and then they will retain at higher rates." It is, "Take care of students' outside commitments for them--give them money for tuition, books, childcare and bills--and they will take more credits and retain at a higher rate" (cf. Kolenovic, Linderman & Karp, 2013). The key here is to delineate between *descriptive* and *prescriptive* predictors. In this case, attempted credit hours per semester *describes* the ability of students to handle certain levels of credit hours *given* their outside obligations. 

The semester GPA (i.e. term GPA) has a wide disparity for those that retained from Fall to Fall than those that did not. The bottom quartile GPA for those that retained is 2.66, whereas the bottom quartile GPA for those that did not retain was 1.50. The top 50% had a GPA of 3.33 or higher for those that retained while the top 50% of those that did not retain had a GPA of 3.00 or higher. It is not surprising that those that retain at higher rates have a higher concentration of GPAs at or above 3.0 whereas the density plot shown in the violin of the "Not Enrolled" for the *Term GPA* is much more dispersed with three main peaks, 0.00 GPA, 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0. In the retained (i.e. "Enrolled") plot for *Term GPA*, the students who have a GPA below 0.70 are *outliers*. 

Institutional GPA, which is the cumulative GPA a student has earned during their time at the college, is almost exclusively 2.0 or higher for retained students. Conversely, students who do not retain from fall to Fall have a flatter distribution. While still maintaining a distribution that is heaviest from 2.0 to 4.0, there are far more in the bottom half with an actual peak in the density plot at 0.0. This is not surprising because a student can only persist in a college by maintaining a 2.0 or higher. The longer a student is at the college, the more likely it is that the student has a 2.0 or higher. In fact, by policy, if a student earns below a 2.0 GPA for two consecutive semesters, that students will be put on Academic Suspension. Three semesters below a 2.0 and a student will be asked to take at least a semester off. 

Earned credit hours for students who retained from Fall to Fall are, on average, two credit hours below what was attempted for all quartiles by these same students, forming almost a Christmas tree shape. These students earned six or more credit hours 71.08% of the time verses students who did not retain earned 6 or more credit hours 54.32% of the time. This predictor is important because it is an indication of dropped credit hours. Significantly, students who drop or fail more than one-third of their credit hours will usually incur financial aid penalties. Some will go on financial aid warning, a state that allows them to enroll the next semester with financial aid but with stipulations. Some will be put on financial aid suspension, which, for most, will create a hard stop for future enrollment for many semesters to come. The reason for this is because most will have to pay for six credits on their own and pass them before they will be allowed to use financial aid again. At the community college level, this means most of these students stop out after financial aid suspension for multiple semesters, sometimes never to return. Students who do not retain attempt fewer credit hours each semester and therefore experience greater problems when they drop because of proportionality. A student enrolled in 9 credits who drops a four credit pathophysiology course finishes the semester with a 55.56% completion rate. A student enrolled in 12 credits, however, who drops a four credit pathophysiology course finishes the semester with a 66.67% completion rate. 

Finally, total institutional hours earned is a great proxy for conscientiousness, mentioned in the introduction. Since colleges cannot administer the Five Factor psychological evaluation at the start of a student's academic career in higher education to ascertain their proclivities, predictors such as the institutional hours earned are necessary to loosely predict it. It stands to reason that the more credits a student earns at an institution, the higher their level of conscientiousness. Remember, the scale is a sliding scale; therefore, students can *lean* towards conscientiousness and not be the *most* conscientious. Not surprisingly, then, students who *do not* retain from Fall to Fall have much fewer credit hours in the bottom 50% than those who do retain. Students who do not retain earn 24 credits or fewer in the bottom 50%, where as students who *do* retain from Fall to Fall have 46 hours or fewer in the bottom 50%, having earned 22 more credits than those who do not make it to the next Fall. One should also notice that for both the "Enrolled" and "Not Enrolled," there is a spike around the 60 credit hour mark. This is because, at the two year level, students graduate at 60 credits; so students will necessarily *not* retain from Fall to Fall once they graduate. For those that *do* retain after earning 60 credits, 50% of them are enrolled in a pre-nursing major or are already in the nursing program at the college. 

### Bootstrap Estimate of Distribution

The violin plots clearly demonstrate that the numeric predictors do not exhibit a normal distribution in relation to the binary response variable. Consequently, a bootstrapped difference of means test was applied in order to accurately ascertain the statistical differences in the means of the two groups. To accomplish this, 10000 simulations for each predictor were ran in relation to the binary outcomes. 

```{r}

#------------------------------------------------------
# Bootstrap for all predictors
#------------------------------------------------------

# List of predictor variable names
predictors <- c('age', 'term_att_crhr', 'term_gpa', 'inst_gpa', 'term_earn_crhr', 'inst_earned')

# Initialize an empty dataframe to store the results
results <- data.frame(variable = character(0),
                      lower_quantile = numeric(0),
                      grand_mean = numeric(0),
                      upper_quantile = numeric(0))

# Number of bootstrap samples
n_bootstrap = 10000

bootstrap_diff_means <- NULL

# Loop through all predictor variables
for (pred in predictors) {
  
  # Extract the data for 'Not Enrolled' and 'Enrolled'
  data_0 <- enrolled[[pred]][enrolled$enrolled == 'Not Enrolled']
  data_1 <- enrolled[[pred]][enrolled$enrolled == 'Enrolled']
  
  # Initialize bootstrap
  for (i in 1:n_bootstrap) {
    
    bootstrap_sample_0 <- sample(data_0, size = length(data_0), replace = TRUE)
    bootstrap_sample_1 <- sample(data_1, size = length(data_1), replace = TRUE)
    
    bootstrap_diff_means[i] <- mean(bootstrap_sample_0) - mean(bootstrap_sample_1)
    
  }
  
  # Calculate 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles for the difference in means
  conf_int_low <- quantile(bootstrap_diff_means, 0.025)
  conf_int_high <- quantile(bootstrap_diff_means, 0.975)
  
  # Grand mean of bootstrap sample mean
  grand_mean_value <- mean(bootstrap_diff_means)
  
  # Store results in the DF
  results <- rbind(results, data.frame(variable = pred,
                                       lower_quantile = conf_int_low,
                                       grand_mean = grand_mean_value,
                                       upper_quantile = conf_int_high))
}

# View results
results

```

**Analysis of Bootstrapped Difference of Means Test**

The 95% confidence interval reveals that none of the intervals for any of the predictors contain zero, which supports the reasonable conclusion that there *is* a statistically significant difference between the means of the two groups for each predictor. Moreover, it suggests there is a statistically significant association between the response variable and each numeric predictor. 

### Mann-Whitney U Test

The null hyothesis of the Mann-Whitney U Test is:

$H_0$: The distributions of both groups are identical.

Alternatively, the alternate hypothesis is:

$H_a$: The distributions of both groups are *not* identical.

```{r}

# Initialize an empty dataframe to store the results
mwu_results <- data.frame(variable = character(0),
                          mann_whitney_U = numeric(0),
                          p_value = numeric(0))

# Loop through all predictors
for(pred in predictors) {
  
  # Extract the data for the "Enrolled" and "Not Enrolled"
  data_0 <- enrolled[[pred]][enrolled$enrolled == 'Not Enrolled']
  data_1 <- enrolled[[pred]][enrolled$enrolled == 'Enrolled']
                     
  # Perform the Mann-Whitney U Test
  mwu_test <- wilcox.test(data_0, data_1)
  
  cat("Running test for:", pred, "\n")
  cat("Statistic:", mwu_test$statistic, "\n")
  cat("P-value:", mwu_test$p.value, "\n\n")
  
  # Put results in empty dataframe
  mwu_results <- rbind(mwu_results, data.frame(variable = pred,
                                               mann_whitney_U = mwu_test$statistic,
                                               p_value = round(mwu_test$p.value[[1]], 6)))
}

# View results of Mann-Whitney Test.
mwu_results

```

**Analysis of Mann-Whitney U Test**

Since the data was not normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney U test was appropriate here. Additionally, the two groups for each predictor are independent, meaning they are distinct and mutually exclusive (i.e. a student cannot be in both groups simultaneously. S/he is necessarily either "Enrolled" or "Not Enrolled" for each semester). The p-values for each predictor are ostensibly zero, which indicates that the distributions between the two groups are statistically significantly different at an $\alpha$ level of 0.01. This reveals nothing of the practical significance of the differences between the distributions, however; it simply provides more context in understanding the data.

### Chi-Square Tests

The $\chi^2$ test of independence helps to ascertain whether there is a significant association between two separate categorical variables. The $\chi^2$ test is given by:

$$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_{ij}-E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$$
where $O_{ij}$ represents the frequency of each observation $i$ from each row and each attribute from the $j^{th}$ column, $E_{ij}$ represents the expected frequency of each observation, $i$, from each row and each attribute from the $j^{th}$ column.

When applied to a binary classifier and a categorical predictor, the test reveals whether the observed distribution of the response variable is independent of the predictor under consideration. The null hypothesis is:

$H_0$: The two categorical variables are independent.

while the alternative hypothesis is:

$H_a$: The two categorical variables are statistically significantly associated or dependent.

When the $\alpha$ value is set to 0.05, if the p-value for the $\chi^2$ test is less than that, then the null hypothesis is rejected and one can conclude that there is a statistically significant association between the response and the categorical variable it is compared to in the test.

**Analysis of Pearson Chi-Squared Test**

Without exception, each Pearson Chi-Squared test shows a statistically significant relationship between each categorical predictor and the response variable, *enrolled*, as each p-value is below the $\alpha$ value of 0.05. All p-values are less than 0.001.

# Model Generation

This analysis will consider several different models for predicting which students will reenroll and those that will not. Since it is more costly to misclassify students who do not reenroll (i.e. have False Positives), the *Specificity* is of utmost importance as well as the *Accuracy* of the model. Logistic Regression and Cross Validated Lasso Logistic Regression are applied as well as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Booted Models (GBM), Naive Bayes (NB), Ks-Nearest Neighbors, CART, and XGBoost. These models are compared using their Accuracy scores as well as the Specificity to determine which one is best for the task.

## Logistic Regression (LR)

A well known form of regression analysis for binary classification is logistic regression. One of its core assumptions is that the data can be separated into roughly equal portions of both outcomes, 1 or 0, True or False, or in the case of this analysis, Enrolled or Not Enrolled. The model is predicated on the logistic function, also called the sigmoid function, $\sigma(z)$, and is defined as:

$$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$
where $z$ is the input of the function and $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm. $z$ is the linear combination of the input features $X$ and the model parameters $\beta$, which is given by the following equation:

$$z = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \dots + \beta_nX_n$$
The $\beta_0, \beta1, \dots, \beta_n$ are the model parameters, and $X_1, X_2, \dots X_n$ are the feature values for each observation. 

The logistic function transforms the linear output into a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability $p$ of the positive class:

$$p = \sigma(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \dots + \beta_nX_n)$$
The result of this calculation is then used to classify an observation into the positive or negative class via a simple heuristic of using a threshold of 0.5. If the predicted probability is greater than 0.5, then the prediction is rounded to 1, and if not, it is rounded to 0. To be clear, this threshold is not a fixed number and can be altered by the modeler if the cost of false positives or false negatives is of particular import. 

To fit the parameters of $\beta$ to the training dataset, this model *typically* uses a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to uncover the values of $\beta$ that maximize the likelihood of observing the classification labels ('Enrolled', 'Not Enrolled') given the features $X$ and parameters $\beta$. 

Using the *enrolled_mod* dataset, run a logistic regression.

OR <- exp(summary(M1)$coeff['hs_matriculationNot From HS', 1])

# Dispersion parameter
M1$deviance/M1$df.res

```
**Analysis of The LR Model Significance**

Based on the $\chi^2$-Test for significance, the LR model is a statistically significant model, meaning it performs better than a naive model.  

### Investigating Residuals

```{r}

     main = 'Fitted vs. Residuals',

     ylab = 'Residuals',
     pch = 19,
     cex = 0.8,

     cex = 0.8,
     col = 'blue')

# Deviance Residual Plot vs Fitted Values
dev_resid <- resid(M1, type = 'deviance')

     main = "Histogram of Deviance Residuals", 
     xlab = "Deviance Residuals")

# QQplot of deviance residuals
qqnorm(dev_resid)
qqline(dev_resid)

# Leverage and Inflence Points (i.e. outliers)
M1_cooks <- cooks.distance(M1)

plot(M1_cooks, 
     main = "Cook's distance plot")
abline(h = 4/nrow(enrolled),
       lty = 2,
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)

# Assess multicollinearity with VIF
library(car)
vif(M1)


```

**Analysis of VIF and GVIF**

Variance Inflation Factor is used to identify multicollinearity in regression models. The *Generalized VIF* is a variation of VIF for predictors that are categorical. The degrees of freedom for categorical variables are the number of categories minus one, while the degrees of freedom for continuous predictors is just one. A common rule of thumb is that if the $GVIF^{(\frac{1}{2*Df})}$ is greater than 2.5 or even 3.0, then *potential* collinearity exists with those variables. Only one of the variables, *all_fafsa*, has a value that slightly exceeds 2.5 at 2.511, while the second highest value is 2.351 (*term_earn_crhr*). Nearly every other predictor is below the threshold of 2.0. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude there is not significant multicollinearity among the predictors. 

```{r}

round(summary(M1)$coeff[,c(1,4)], 6) %>%
  cbind() %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  filter(Pr...z.. <= 0.05) %>%
  rename('P_Val' = 'Pr...z..')

summary(M1)

# Odds based on coefficients
cat('Assuming all other variables are held constant, the odds of a Not From HS ', '\n',
    'Not Enrolling in the next Fall semester who was enrolled in the previous Fall semester ', '\n',
    'is ', round(exp(summary(M1)$coeff['hs_matriculationNot From HS',1]) - 1, 6) * 100, '% higher than the reference group.', sep = "")

# Odds Ratio (OR) result of exponentiating the coeff
OR <- exp(summary(M1)$coeff['stypeG', 1])

OR - 1

```


**Analysis of LR**

The LR model produces an *accuracy rate* of 0.6773 and a *specificity* of 0.8222. In this case, the positive class is "Enrolled," which is why the *specificity* is so important. Recall, it is more costly to misclassify a student who does not reenroll from Fall to Fall. A strong *specificity*, therefore, is paramount. There is much to be gleaned from the logistic regression equation.

### LR Goodness of Fit Tests

To test whether the logistic regression model is a good fit, two separate tests should be run--the deviance residuals test and the Pearson residuals test. Both have the same null hypothesis.

$H_0$: The model *is* a good fit.

$H_a$: The model *is not* a good fit.

This is one of the rare times the researcher is hoping for a large p-value because a large p-value would indicate that the model fits the data reasonably well. A small p-value, one under the traditional $\alpha$-value of 0.05, would mean the researcher rejects the null hypothesis that the model is a good fit and instead conclude that the model is not a good fit for the data. 

```{r}

#Deviance
dev <- 1 - pchisq(M1$deviance, M1$df.residual)

#Pearson residuals
pear_resid <- resid(M1, type = 'pearson')
pears <- 1 - pchisq(sum(pear_resid^2), M1$df.residual)

```

### Evaluation of Deviance Residuals 

```{r}

dev_res <- resid(M1, type = 'deviance')

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

qqPlot(dev_res, 
       main = 'Deviance Residuals',
       xlab = 'Quantiles',
       ylab = 'Residuals')

#Histogram
hist(dev_res, 
     main = 'Deviance Residuals',
     xlab = 'Residuals',
     ylab = 'Frequency',
     col = 'purple',
     border = 'gold')

```


Both of these tests produce a value above the $\alpha$ threshold of 0.05, which means we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the model *is* a good fit for the data. 

**Student Type Analysis**

Each of the coefficients for the different categories of the student type predictor were identified as statistically significant, meaning they are statistically significantly non-zero, at a confidence interval of 95%. Consequently, there is enough evidence to conclude that the effects of these categories on the response variable are real and not the result of random chance. 

The reference level in the student type is that of a continuing student. A continuing student is any student who has attended the college in any previous semester and is not in high school or a guest student; the previous semester could be several semesters back and does not need to be the semester immediately before the current semester.

A guest student enrolls at the college to usually take one or only a handful of classes. This student is non-degree seeking and cannot be eligible for Financial Aid. These students still must comply with all prerequisite requirements for classes they wish to take. Guest students are 82.79% more likely to not be retained by the next Fall semester than a student who is a continuing student, assuming all other variables are held constant.* 

A high school student, on the other hand, is 65.33% more likely to be retained by the next Fall semester compared to a continuing student. 

A new student is 68.94% more likely to be retained by the next Fall semester compared to a continuing student. 

Transfer students have a similar outcome to new students in that they are 64.15% more likely to be retained by the next Fall semester compared to a continuing student.

Both new students and transfer students have something in common--it is their first semester at the college. One can surmise that students in their first semester at the college have many things going for them. First, they have a clean slate, which means they are not on financial aid warning or suspension, no Accounts Receivable holds, and no academic suspension holds. Second, students in their first semester at the college tend to be highly motivated and naively optimistic. They have no back story, nothing to prove or disprove their hopes for their academic futures. After their first semester, their self-perception is either reified, or they face some unexpected challenges that they were unable to fully overcome. Interestingly too, these students, even if they do have a poor first semester, will still typically be able to enroll for the following Spring and then Fall. It takes three semesters to go on academic suspension and can take about as long to go on financial aid suspension. 

Recall with continuing students, these students will include students who graduate as well as those that are trying to finish their degrees. Therefore, *some* of the students who do not reenroll from Fall to Fall have simply graduated. The average student at this institution will take about nine credits a semester, which allows for a student to finish about half of their degree from Fall to Spring to Summer with 9, 9, and 6 credits, respectively. Importantly, since this model will be ran on students in the Fall, we will not know who is going to graduate or apply for graduation. Therefore, we cannot include that in the model.

**Gender Analysis**

None of the self-declared genders of the student were found to be statistically significantly non-zero, which means none of them were found to have a measurable effect on the likelihood that a student would or would not reenroll from Fall to Fall.

**Ethnicity Analysis**

Only two of the self-declared ethnicity categories were found to be statistically significantly non-zero at an α-level of 0.05—*Hispanic*, and *Missing.* Recall that in the early stages of data exploration that about six percent of the ethnicity predictor had missing values. Consequently, a new category for this predictor was created for these missing values simply called "Missing." In this case, it proved to be valuable, which is precisely why one should not just exclude observations with missing values a priori. Each of these categories, therefore, have a distinct and measurable effect on the likelihood that a student will reenroll or not in the following Fall semester.

The reference group for this categorical predictor is "Caucasian/White." So as not to repeat the phrase for each category, it is understood that each of these ethnicity are self-declared by the student.

Students who are Hispanic are 22.60% more likely to be retained from Fall to Fall than White students.

Students who did not declare an ethnicity are 13.90% more likely to be retained than students who are White.

**Residency Analysis**

Not a single residency category was statistically significantly non-zero.

**Academic Standing Analysis**

Each of the *academic standing* categories were found to be statistically significant at an $\alpha$ level of 0.05, which means there is good reason to conclude that these categories have real effects on whether a student retains from Fall to Fall or not, and it is not a consequence of random chance. 

The reference level for this variable is students who are in "Good Standing" with the college, meaning they have a GPA that is above a 2.0.

Students who do not have a GPA yet, are 48.59% more likely to not be retained at the college than a student who is in good standing.

Students who are on academic probation at the college are 66.67% more likely to not be retained than students who are in good standing.

Students who are on academic suspension are 40.73% more likely to not be retained than students in good standing.

**Numeric Predictor Analysis**

With the exception of a student's age, all coefficients for the numeric predictors were found to be statistically significantly non-zero. For each additional credit hour a student earns at the college (i.e. *inst_earned*), the student is 55.86% more likely to be retained. As cautioned before, this is *descriptive* of students and not *prescriptive*. Each additional attempted credit hour per semester makes a student only about 6.14% more likely to be enrolled the following semester. For each additional credit hour a student *earns* in a given semester, the likelihood of them not enrolling the following Fall *increases* by 36.67%. To some degree, this makes sense because as students earn more credit hours, they move closer to graduation, transfer, or both. For each additional point in a student's semester GPA, they are 26.90% more likely to be reenrolled the following Fall semester.

**Financial Aid Predictor Analysis**

All categories of the financial aid data were found to be statistically significantly non-zero except the Summer+ program. A student who receives pell grants is 18.80% more likely to be retained than a student who receives no scholarships, loans, or grants. A student who receives subsidized loans is 21.70% more likely to be retained in the next Fall semester than a student who recieves no grants, loans or scholarships. A student who receives unsubsidized loans is 16.31% more likely to be retained in the following Fall semester than a student who receives no loans, scholarships, or grants. Kansas Promise scholarship recipients are 44.89% more likely to be enrolled in the following Fall semester than a student who receives no loans, scholarships, or grants. Finally, a student is 5.12% more likely to not reenroll in the following Fall for each additional loan, scholarship, or grant that s/he receives. The reason why is unclear, as that is a counterintuitive finding from this LR model, but nevertheless, it is the case. 

**High School Matriculation Analysis**

For this variable, there were only two categories, students who enrolled in the Fall directly after high school graduation (i.e. "From HS") and students who enrolled after one or more semesters after high school graduation (i.e. "Not From HS"). The reference group for this predictor is "From HS." Students who are enrolled in a Fall semester and have not enrolled directly after their high school graduation the previous May, are 77.36% more likely to not be enrolled the following Fall.

**Fully Online Analysis**

the "fully_online" student coefficient was found to be statistically significantly non-zero. The reference group was students who are not fully online. Students who are fully online are 13.27% more likely to not be enrolled the following Fall semester than students who are not fully online.

* This phrase "all else held constant" or sometimes more esoterically, *ceteris paribus*, is presumed for all of the analysis for the logistic regression.

### Cross Validated Lasso Logistic Regression

The Lasso Regression adds an L1 penalty term that shrinks the coefficients towards zero. It is characterized by the following equation:

$$\lambda\sum_{J=1}^p |\beta_j|$$
$\lambda$ is the non-negative tuning parameter that, as it increases, more coefficients are lowered to zero. When $\lambda$ is zero, it produces the regular maximum likelihood estimates typical for a logistic regression model.

Lasso regression encourages sparsity within the coefficients, ultimately performing variable selection by setting the less influential predictors to zero, which is advantageous when the dataset has high dimensionality. Consequently, it aids in the prevention of overfitting.

**Analysis**

The CV Lasso LR identified *age*, *inst_earned*, *term_att_crhr*, *term_earn_crhr*, *term_gpa*, *no_pell*, *pell*, *subsidized*, *unsubsidized*, *summer_plus*, *kansas_promise*, and *all_fafsa* as the most influential predictors for the model. This model produced an accuracy score of 0.6294 and a specificity of 0.7863.  

## SVM

*Do NOT RUN THIS WITHOUT A LOT OF TIME SET ASIDE. THIS TAKES MULTIPLE HOURS TO RUN. TRIED RUNNING IT ON 11.7.23 AND IT JUST RAN AND RAN AND RAN FOR SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT MAKING ANY HEADWAY. I DISCOVERED THAT WHEN THE PARAMETER IN trainControl(), 'classprobs', IS SET TO TRUE (THE DEFAULT IS FALSE), THAT THE SVM IS THEN RUNNING ONE MODEL TO IDENTIFY CLASSES AND THE OTHER TO IDENTIFY THE PROBABILITY THAT THE OBSERVATION IS ONE OF THE CLASSES. THIS MAKES THE RUN TIME AT LEAST DOUBLE. SVM IS SO COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE, IT WOULD HAVE TO FAR OUTPERFORM THE GBM AND XGBOOST MODELS FOR ME TO GO WITH IT. AT PRESENT, ITS SPECIFICITY IS UP THERE WITH THE CART MODEL AND WITH A BETTER ACCURACY. THE PROBLEM IS HOW LONG IT TAKES TO RUN. IF I WERE TO TRY TO KNIT THIS FILE WITH THE SVM, IT WOULD TAKE THROUGH THE NIGHT AND I WOULD GET ONE CHANCE PER DAY FOR IT TO BE EXACTLY RIGHT.*

## Naive Bayes Model

The Naive Bayes performed poorly from the start. Therefore, in order to ascertain whether this was a one-off performance or if it was durable, a Monte Carlo Cross Validation was used to test what the mean accuracy, accuracy p-value, and specificity was over 100 runs.

```{r}

library(e1071)

# Conduct MCCV on Naive Bayes 
B = 100

# Make bins to store results
acc = NULL
acc_pval = NULL
spec = NULL

# Run MCCV for the NB model
for(i in 1:B){
  
  training.samples <- enrolled_mod$enrolled %>%
                     createDataPartition(p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
  
  train.data <- enrolled_mod[training.samples, ]
  test.data <- enrolled_mod[-training.samples, ] 
  
  nb_model <- naiveBayes(enrolled~., data = train.data)

  nb_model_pred <- predict(nb_model, newdata = test.data)
  
  acc = rbind(acc, cbind(confusionMatrix(nb_model_pred, test.data$enrolled)[[3]]['Accuracy'][[1]]))
  acc_pval = rbind(acc_pval, cbind(confusionMatrix(nb_model_pred, test.data$enrolled)[[3]]['AccuracyPValue'][[1]]))
  spec = rbind(spec, cbind(confusionMatrix(nb_model_pred, test.data$enrolled)[[4]]['Specificity'][[1]]))
  
}

# Make dataframe for accuracy
acc_df <- round(apply(acc, 2, mean),4) %>%
              cbind(round(apply(acc, 2, var),10)) %>%
              data.frame() %>%
              rename('Avg' = '.',
                     'Avg var' = 'V2')

# Make dataframe for accuracy p-value

                cbind(round(apply(acc_pval, 2, var),10)) %>%
                data.frame() %>%
                rename('Avg' = '.',

# Combine all results and name rows
combined_df <- acc_df %>%
                rbind(acc_pval_df, spec_df)

row.names(combined_df) <- c('accuracy', 'accuracy_p_val', 'specificity')

# view dataframe
combined_df

```


**NB Analysis**

The NB Classifier combined with MCCV shows an average accuracy score over 100 trials of 0.6101, each time with a accuracy p-value lower than an $\alpha$ value of 0.05, meaning it is statistically significantly better than just guessing, but  not by much. The *specificity*, which is a measurement I really care about since it is more costly to misclassify students who are not going to retain from  Fall to Fall than to correctly predict who is going to retain from Fall to Fall, is only 0.5385. By both metrics, NB performs only slightly better than logistic regression.

*KNN is another one that takes a bit of time to run. Therefore, make sure you're prepared for that before you run it.*

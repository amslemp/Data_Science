# Location Data

The location data is a single parquet file created by combining the previous four Fall semester's from the internal **IR 20th-Day credit hour report**. The columns have been heavily modified from the original report, which wastes a tremendous amount of memory on unnecessary features and duplicated features. 

The data stores the location from which students take each of their courses. Ultimately, it is used to create a new feature that identifies students who are fully online versus students who take at least one class in person.

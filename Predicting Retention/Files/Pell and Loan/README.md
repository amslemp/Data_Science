Pell and Loan Data

This data is pulled directly from the Banner DB using Oracle's PL/SQL. It contains the information on the types of scholarships students have, whether they are Pell grant recipients or not, whether they are Kansas Promise Scholarship recipients, and those who have none of these. Keep in mind, it is possible a student could have some, all, or none of these attributes. 

These files include all five Fall semesters under consideration, saved as one parquet file. Saved in the format `Pell and Loan FA19 - FA23.parquet`. Obviously, changing the years to match whatever is current.
